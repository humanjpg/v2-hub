# Public Beta 1

After nearly 3,000 commits, nearly a year of development, and nearly a swimming pool’s worth of coffee, we’re finally here!

## Answers to questions you probably have

### Where do I get the latest release?
Right here in Github. Head to the [Releases section](https://github.com/statamic/v2-beta/releases) and download the latest packaged zip file (not **Source Code**).

### Where are the docs?

Right here: <http://docs.talonsbeard.com>. Please don't share them publically.

### OMG something broke where do submit a bug??

First, make sure it's not a cache issue. Clear your cache using `php please cache:clear` or delete everything inside `local/cache` and `local/storage` and try again. If your issue goes away, let us know what happened so we can fine tune our cache invalidation. Otherwise, open an [Issue](https://github.com/statamic/v2-beta/issues/new) with as much detail as you can. PHP/Server environment, content types, YAML/template examples, etc.
