# Statamic 2 Feature Requests and Bug Reports

## Reporting a bug

1. Check to see if there's a similar issue filed already (open or closed). 

2. Make sure it's not a cache issue. Clear your cache using `php please cache:clear` or delete everything inside `local/cache` and `local/storage` and try again. If your issue goes away, let us know what happened so we can fine tune our cache invalidation.
3. Otherwise, open an Issue with as much detail as you can. PHP/Server environment, content types, YAML/template examples, etc. Feel free to remove any non-applicable sections of the Issue template.

## Requesting a feature

Fire up an Issue and remove the bug report template stuff and write away.
