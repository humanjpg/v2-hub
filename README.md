# v2-beta (Alpha 17)

## Contribution Guide

Thank you for being willing to try, test, and experiment with pre-release software! We value your input, feedback, thoughts, and time, and in the interest of all of those things, we've written up a notes on how you can best help us, as we best help you.

### What to test

Check out the included new theme and demo site, Redwood. Play with the templates. Add pages, make collections and entries. Use it like you would. Try upgrading a site. Let us know if anything breaks, issues with cache, bad data, you name it.

The Control Panel hasn't had it's final round of polishing, so be gentle.

### Issues

**DO** report or create issues for any of the following:

- Errors and Exceptions
- Unexpected Behavior
- Issues with Cache
- Inconsistencies between v1 and v2 not already documented as intentional
- Any unusually long load times
- Anything named awkwardly, organized unintuitively, or any workflows that are unnatural
- Suggest UX improvements and how they might be accomplished

**DON'T** report any of the following:

- Visual inconsistencies between sections of the Control Panel
- Missing/untranslatable strings in the Control Panel
- Unfinished features not already documented as unfinished
- Typos or bad grammar in the docs. We're still in draft mode.
- Make any hard/concrete/extremely specific requests - we want to nail the GOALS and split hairs on the details.
